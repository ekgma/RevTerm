Python Style & Coding Guide
===========================

For Python code in CPAchecker, we use [Black](https://github.com/python/black)
as automatic code formatter.
Install it with `pip3 install black` and run it with `black .`.

We try to follow the official Python style guide
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

Please use `flake8` to check your code for warnings.
