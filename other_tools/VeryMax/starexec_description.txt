VeryMax is a tool for checking automatically safety properties, and proving termination and non termination for programs written in a tiny subset of the C plus plus language which includes linear operations with integer variables and loop and conditional statements. It can also handle integer transition systems. VeryMax is based on the work described in [Borralleras et al. WST2016], [Brockschmidt et al. FMCAD2015], [Larraz et al. FMCAD2013], and [Larraz et al. CAV2014].
